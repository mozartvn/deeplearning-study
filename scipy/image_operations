# SciPy
#
# Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays. SciPy builds on this, and provides a large number of functions that operate on numpy arrays and are useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
#
# The best way to get familiar with SciPy is to browse the documentation. We will highlight some parts of SciPy that you might find useful for this class.

from scipy.misc import imread, imsave, imresize

# Read an JPED image into a numpy array
im = imread('assets/cat.jpg')
print(im.dtype, im.shape) # Prints "unit8 (400, 248, 3)"

# We can tint the image by scaling each of the color channels
# by a different scala constant. The image has shape (400, 248, 3);
# we multiply it by the array [1, 0.95, 0.9] of shape(3,);
# numpy broadcasting means that this leaves the read channel unchanged,
# and multiplies the green and blue channels by 0.95 and 0.9
# respectively

im_tinted = im * [1, 0.95, 0.9]

# Resize the tinted image to be 300 by 300 pixels
img_tinted = imresize(im_tinted, (300, 300))

# Write the tinted image back to disk
imsave('assets/cat_tinted.jpg', img_tinted)

print(img_tinted[1,1:3])
